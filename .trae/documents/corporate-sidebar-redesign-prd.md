# Corporate Web App Sidebar Redesign - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

This project involves redesigning the corporate web application sidebar to improve user experience, modernize the visual design, and enhance navigation efficiency based on the Figma design specifications. The new sidebar will maintain all existing functionality while introducing a more intuitive and visually appealing interface that aligns with modern corporate design standards.

The redesign aims to solve navigation complexity issues, improve visual hierarchy, and provide better user engagement through enhanced UI/UX patterns while maintaining the existing modular structure for Aid Management, Donation Management, Message Management, and other core modules.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 User Roles

The sidebar maintains the existing role-based access system without modification:

| Role | Registration Method | Core Permissions |
|------|---------------------|------------------|
| Admin User | System administrator assignment | Full access to all modules and system settings |
| Module Manager | Department-based assignment | Access to specific modules (Aid, Donations, Messages, etc.) |
| Regular User | Standard employee registration | Limited access based on department and role |

### 2.2 Feature Module

Our corporate sidebar redesign consists of the following main components:

1. **Header Section**: Logo area, user profile, and global actions
2. **Navigation Menu**: Hierarchical menu structure with expandable sections
3. **Module Sections**: Organized groupings for different business functions
4. **Footer Section**: System information and quick settings
5. **Mobile Responsive Layout**: Collapsible sidebar for mobile devices

## 3. Core Process

### Main User Navigation Flow

1. **Initial Access**: User logs in and sees the sidebar in its default state with collapsed expandable sections
2. **Module Navigation**: User clicks on a module section (e.g., "Bağış Yönetimi") to expand and view sub-items
3. **Page Selection**: User selects a specific page from the expanded menu, which highlights the active state
4. **Context Awareness**: Sidebar maintains the expanded state of the current module and highlights the active page
5. **Mobile Interaction**: On mobile devices, sidebar appears as an overlay that can be toggled via hamburger menu

### Admin Flow

1. **Full Access**: Admin users see all modules and have access to system management sections
2. **User Management**: Access to user management and system configuration through the Definitions and System modules
3. **Monitoring**: View system status and analytics through dedicated dashboard sections
